## Overview

An implementation of the [Pair Adjacent Violators](http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/janspubs/2009/reports/deleeuw_hornik_mair_R_09.pdf) algorithm for [isotonic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotonic_regression), implemented in Kotlin, but usable from any language that can use Java libraries (including Java itself, of course).

Note this algorithm is also known as "Pool Adjacent Violators".
